# Supply-Chain
Supply-Chain Project

"Supply-Chain" repository contains my implementation of the Supply Chain course project in MS in 2014. We aimed to solve an optimization problem for a supply chain to minimizing the costs. The final formula exists in "Math Type - Goal Function" folder, which is a goal function (minimizing function) and different constraints that must be valid. Then we decided for other variables to minimize the goal function and meanwhile all of constraints remained valid. This problem is solved by Lingo and OpenSolver and the solutions of them exists respectively in "Implementation by Lingo" and "Implementation by OpenSolver" folders.

Lingo is the modeling language and optimizer. LINGO is a comprehensive tool designed to make building and solving mathematical optimization models easier and more efficient.  LINGO provides a completely integrated package that includes a powerful language for expressing optimization models, a full-featured environment for building and editing problems, and a set of fast built-in solvers capable of efficiently solving most classes of optimization models.  LINGO's primary features include: Algebraic Modeling Language, Convenient Data Options, Model Interactively or Create Turnkey Applications, Powerful Solvers and Tools.

OpenSolver is the Open Source linear, integer and non-linear optimizer for Microsoft Excel. OpenSolver is an Excel VBA add-in that extends Excelâ€™s built-in Solver with more powerful solvers.

The report of the project was presented in persian language in "About Project - Persian.pdf" file.
